# Part 1 - Docker on Windows

We'll start with the basics and get a feel for running Docker on Windows.

If you've previously used Docker, it's still worth following along. This workshop uses the expanded Docker CLI syntax (like `docker container ls` rather than `docker ps`), so it may introduce you to some new commands, and it shows some more advanced usage of Windows Docker containers.

## <a name="1"></a>Step 1. Run some simple Windows Docker containers

There are different ways to use containers:

1. In the background for long-running services like websites and databases
2. Interactively for connecting to the container like a remote server
3. To run a single task, which could be a PowerShell script or a custom app

In this section you'll try each of those options and see how Docker manages the workload.

---

## Run a task in a Nano Server container

.exercise[

  - This is the simplest kind of container to start with. In PowerShell run:

  ```
  docker container run microsoft/nanoserver hostname
  ```
]

You'll see the output written from the `hostname` command.

Docker keeps a container running as long as the process it started inside the container is still running. In this case the `hostname` process completes when the output is written, so the container stops. The Docker platform doesn't delete resources by default, so the container still exists. 

List all containers and you'll see your Nano Server container in the `Exited` state:

```
> docker container ls --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
18876defb3d6        microsoft/nanoserver   "hostname"          7 seconds ago       Exited (0) 5 seconds ago
```

> Note that the container ID *is* the hostname that the container displayed.

Containers which do one task and then exit can be very useful. You could build a Docker image which installs the Azure PowerShell module and bundles a set of scripts to create a cloud deployment. Anyone can execute that task just by running the container - they don't need the scripts or the right version of the Azure module, they just need to pull the Docker image.

I use a task container to create all the VMs for this workshop, using my [azure-vm-provisioner](https://github.com/sixeyed/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/azure-vm-provisioner) image. That image packages up a set of Terraform scripts in an image with Terraform installed, so anyone can use it to provision VMs, using their own Azure subscription details.


## Run an interactive Windows Server Core container

The [microsoft/windowsservercore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore) image is effectively a full Windows Server 2016 OS, without the UI. You can explore an image by running an interactive container. 

Run this to start a Windows Server Core container and connect to it:

```
docker container run --interactive --tty --rm microsoft/windowsservercore powershell
```

When the container starts you'll drop into a PowerShell session with the default prompt `PS C:\>`. Docker has attached to the console in the container, relaying input and output between your PowerShell window and the PowerShell session in the container.

Run some commands to see how the Windows Server Core image is built:

- `ls C:\` - lists the C drive contents, you'll see this is a minimal installation of Windows 
- `Get-Process` - shows all running processes in the container. There are a number of Windows Services, and the PowerShell exe
- `Get-WindowsFeature` - shows the Windows feature which are available or already installed

Now run `exit` to leave the PowerShell session, which stops the container process. Using the `--rm` flag means Docker now removes that container (if you run `docker container ls --all` again, you won't see the Windows Server Core container).

Interactive containers are useful when you are putting together your own image. You can run a container and verify all the steps you need to deploy your app, and capture them in a Dockerfile. 

> You *can* [commit](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) a container to make an image from it - but you should avoid that wherever possible. It's much better to use a repeatable [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to build your image. You'll see that shortly.

## Run a background SQL Server container

Background containers are how you'll run most applications. Here's a simple example using another image from Microsoft - [microsoft/mssql-server-windows-express](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-windows-express/) which builds on top of the Windows Server Core image and comes with SQL Server Express installed.

Run it in the background as a detached container:

```
docker container run --detach --name sql `
 --env ACCEPT_EULA=Y `
 --env sa_password=DockerCon!!! `
 microsoft/mssql-server-windows-express:2016-sp1
```

> The workshop VM pre-loads a set of Docker images. If you don't have a local copy of an image, Docker will pull it when you first run a container. 

As long as the SQL Server process keeps running, Docker will keep the container running in the background.

You can check what's happening by viewing the logs from the container, and seeing the process list:

```
docker container logs sql
docker container top sql
```

The SQL Server instance is isolated in the container, because no ports have been made available to the host. Traffic can't get into Docker containers from the host, unless ports are explicitly published. You can't connect an external client - like SQL Server Management Studio - to this container (we'll see how to do that later on). Other containers in the same Docker network can access the SQL Server container, and you can run commands inside the container through Docker.

Check what the time is inside the database container:

```
docker container exec sql `
 powershell "Invoke-SqlCmd -Query 'SELECT GETDATE()' -Database Master"
```

## <a name="2"></a>Step 2. Explore the filesystem and users in Windows containers

The SQL Server container is stil running in the background. You can connect an interactive PowerShell session to the container by running `exec`:

```
docker container exec --interactive --tty sql powershell
```

Have a look at the `Program Files` directory, and then drill down into the SQL Server default file locations:

```
ls 'C:\Program Files'
cd 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server'
ls .\MSSQL13.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\data
```

The `.mdf` and `.ldf` files are stored inside the container. You can run SQL statements to store data, but when you remove the container, the data is lost. For stateful services like database, you'll want to run them with the data physically stored outside of the container, so you can replace the container but retain the data. I'll cover that later in the workshop.

Now check the processes running in the container:

```
Get-Process
```

You'll see one of the processes is `sqlservr`, which is the database engine. There are also two `powershell` processes, one is the container startup process and the other is this PowerShell session. Compare the user accounts for those processes:

```
Get-Process -Name sqlservr -IncludeUserName
Get-Process -Name powershell -IncludeUserName
```

The SQL Server process runs under the normal `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. All the default user groups and accounts are present in the Windows Server Core Docker image, with all the usual access permissions. The PowerShell processes are running as `User Manager\ContainerAdministrator`. That's the default account for processes running in Windows Docker containers, and it has admin privileges.

On Windows Server 2016, those processes are actually running in isolated environments on the host. 

> Open another PowerShell terminal, and repeat the `Get-Process` cmdlet

This time you're listing all the PowerShell processes running on the server:

```
Get-Process -Name powershell -IncludeUserName
```

You'll see your PowerShell sessions and the two container processes - with the same process IDs listed in the container - but with a blank username. There are two important takeaways from this:

- Windows Server container processes run natively on the host, which is why they are so efficient
- container processes run as an unknown user on the host, so a rogue container process wouldn't be able to access host files or other processes.

Close the second PowerShell window, and exit the interactive Docker session in the first PowerShell window:

```
exit
``` 

Now clean up, by removing all containers:

```
docker container rm --force $(docker container ls --quiet --all)
```

## <a name="2"></a>Step 2: Package and run a custom app using Docker

Next you'll learn how to package your own Windows apps as Docker images, using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). 

The Dockerfile syntax is straightforward. In this task you'll walk through two Dockerfiles which package websites to run in Windows Docker containers. The first example is very simple, and the second is more involved. By the end of this task you'll have a good understanding of the main Dockerfile instructions.


## Build a simple website image

Have a look at the [Dockerfile for this app](part-1/hostname-app/Dockerfile), which builds a simple ASP.NET website running that displays the host name of the server. There are only two instructions:

- [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) specifes the image to use as ther starting point for this image. `microsoft/aspnet` is an image owned by Microsoft, that comes with IIS and ASP.NET installed on top of Windows Server Core
- [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies a file from the host into the image, at a known location.

The Dockerfile copies a sinple `.aspx` file into the content directory for the default IIS website. Run `docker image build` to execute the steps in the Dockerfile and package the app:

```
cd "$env:workshop\part-1\hostname-app"
docker image build --tag "$env:dockerId/hostname-app" .
```

The output shows Docker executing each instruction in the Dockerfile, and tagging the final image with your Docker ID.

Run your website using a detached container, just like you did with SQL Server, but this time publishing the HTTP port so traffic can be passed from the host into the container:

```
docker container run --detach --publish 80:80 --name app "$env:dockerId/hostname-app"
```

Any external traffic coming into the server on port 80 will now be directed into the container. When you're connected to the host, to browse the website you need to fetch the IP address of the container:

```
$ip = docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' app
```

Now you can open the browser at the container's IP address and see the ASP.NET site:

```
firefox "http://$ip"
```

> You need to use the container IP address locally because Windows doesn't have a full loopback networking stack. You can read more about that [on my blog](https://blog.sixeyed.com/published-ports-on-windows-containers-dont-do-loopback/).


## Run multiple instances of your website in containers

Let's see how lightweight the containerized application is. This PowerShell loop starts five containers from the same website image:

```
for ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
    & docker container run --detach --publish-all --name "app-$i" "$Env:dockerId/hostname-app"
}
```
> The `publish-all` flag publishes all the ports from the container to random ports on the host. Only one process can listen on a port, and we're already using port 80 in the previous container. Using random host ports means we can start multiple containers, and access them using port 80 on the container.

You can see all the containers running with `docker container ls`. And then run this script to fetch the IP address of each container and open a browser:

```
for ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) {
    $ip = & docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' "app-$i"
    firefox "http://$ip"
}
```

When the browsers have finished loading, you'll see that each site displays a different hostname, which is the same as the container ID Docker generates in each case. On the host you have six `w3wp` processes running, and you can see the memory and CPU usage with `Get-Process`:

```
Get-Process -Name w3wp | select Id, Name, WorkingSet, Cpu
```

On my Azure VM, the worker processes average around 50MB of RAM and 5 seconds of CPU time.

This is a simple ASP.NET website running in Docker, with just two lines in a Dockerfile. But it has some drawbacks. First, there are no logs - IIS stores request logs in the container filesystem, but Docker is only listening for logs on the standard output from the startup program. There's no automatic relay from the log files to the console output, so there are no HTTP access log entries in the containers:

```
docker container logs app-0
```

The other issue is that it took a few seconds for each website to show. That's because the IIS service doesn't start a worker process until the first HTTP request comes in. The first website user takes the hit of starting the worker process. We can use a more advanced Dockerfile to address those issues.

## Build and run a more complex website image

For the next example, the [Dockerfile](part-1/tweet-app/Dockerfile) is a better representation of a real-world script. These are the main features:

- it is based [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) `microsoft/iis:windowsservercore`, so the image will start with a clean Windows Server 2016 deployment, with IIS already installed
- it uses the [SHELL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#shell) instruction to switch to PowerShell when building the Dockerfile, so the commands to run are all in PowerShell
- it configures IIS to write all log output to a single file, using the `Set-WebConfigurationProperty` cmdlet
- it copies the [start.ps1](part-1/tweet-app/start.ps1) startup script and [index.html](part-1/tweet-app/index.html) files from the host into the image
- it specifies `start.ps1` as the [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) to run when containers start. The script starts the IIS Windows Service and relays the log file entries to the console
- it adds a [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) which makes an HTTP GET request to the site and returns whether it got a 200 response code

To build the Dockerfile, change to the `tweet-app` directory and run the `build` command:

```
cd "$env:workshop\part-1\tweet-app"
docker image build --tag "$env:dockerId/tweet-app" .
```

You'll see output on the screen as Docker runs each instruction in the Dockerfile. Once it's built you'll see a `Successfully built...` message. If you repeat the `docker image build` command again, it will complete in seconds. That's because Docker caches the [image layers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/) and only runs instructions if the Dockerfile has changed since the cached version.

When the build completes, run the new app in the same way:

```
docker container run --detach --publish 8080:80 --name tweet-app "$env:dockerId/tweet-app"
```

Find the container IP address and browse to it:

```
$ip = docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}' tweet-app
firefox "http://$ip"
```

## Push your images to Docker Hub

Now if you list the images and filter on your Docker ID, you'll see the images you've built today, with the newest at the top:

```
docker image ls -f reference="$env:dockerId/*"
```

My output looks like this:

```
REPOSITORY                      TAG              IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
sixeyed/tweet-app               latest           64fcfbceea4b        About a minute ago   10.8GB
sixeyed/hostname-app            latest           bf41287f7762        35 minutes ago       13.5GB
sixeyed/docker-workshop-verify  latest           dcf4c3874c4e        41 minutes ago       10.4GB
```

Those images are only stored in the cache on your Azure VM, and that VM will be deleted after the workshop. Next we'll push the images to a public repository so you can run them from any Windows machine with Docker.

Distribution is built into the Docker platform. You can build images locally and push them to a public or private [registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/), making them available to other users. Anyone with access can pull that image and run a container from it. The behavior of the app in the container will be the same for everyone, because the image contains the fully-configured app - the only requirements to run it are Windows and Docker.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is the public registry for Docker images. You've already logged in using `docker login`, so now upload your images to the Hub:

```
docker image push $env:dockerId/hostname-app
docker image push $env:dockerId/tweet-app
```

You'll see the upload progress for each layer in the Docker image. The `hostname-app` image uploads quickly as it only adds one small layer on top of Microsoft's ASP.NET image. The `tweet-app` image takes longer to push - there are more layers, and the configured IIS layer runs to 40MB. 

The logical size of those images is over 10GB each, but the bulk of that is in the Windows Server Core base image. Those layers are already stored in Docker Hub, so they don't get uploaded - only the new parts of the image get pushed. And Docker shares layers between images, so every image that builds on Windows Server Core will share the cached layers for that image.

You can browse to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), login with your Docker ID and see your newly-pushed Docker images. These are public repositories, so anyone can pull the image - you don't even need a Docker ID to pull public images.

## Next Up

That's it for Part 1. Next in [Part 2](part-2.md) we'll get stuck into modernizing an old ASP.NET app, by bringing it to a modern application platform.

Before we move on, let's clear up all the running containers:

```
docker container rm --force $(docker container ls --quiet --all)
```
